# [Advanced Topics in Deep Reinforcement learning](https://deeppavlov.ai/rl_course_2020) course project [WIP]

Implementation of [Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf) is currently in progress

TODO:

- [x] Implement validation 
- [x] Change training process (switch to sessions)
- [x] Add Prioritized Experience Replay

Special TODO:

- [ ] Replace DDPG with better algorithm
- [ ] Upgrade state representation unit
