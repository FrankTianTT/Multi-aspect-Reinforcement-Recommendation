# Reinforcement learning for Recommendation Systems

Implementation of [Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf)

TODO:

- [x] Implement validation 
- [x] Change training process (switch to sessions)
- [x] Add Prioritized Experience Replay

Special TODO:

- [x] Add Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck noise for better exploration
